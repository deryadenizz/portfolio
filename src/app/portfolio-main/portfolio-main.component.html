            Introducing my Weather Forecast App project, a fantastic application
            developed as part of the SheCodes Plus workshop! 🎉 This project
            showcases my proficiency in front-end development and integrating

            This app allows you to check the current weather and the 5-day
            forecast for any city. You can search for a city by name, or use the
            "current location" button to get the weather for your current
            location. You can also switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit to see
            the temperature in your preferred unit. 🌍🌤️💨
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and utilizes the
            OpenWeatherMap API to get weather data. The app is also responsive
            and looks great on all devices, from desktop to mobile. 📱💻🌐
          </p>

          <p class="card-text">
            I thoroughly enjoyed developing this project and expanding my
            knowledge in front-end development through the SheCodes Plus

            possibilities to create innovative projects that enhance the user

          <p class="card-text">
            🌍 Welcome to the World Clock app! This is a cool little project
            that I created to help you keep track of time in different cities
            around the world. ⏰
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            I put together a beautiful user interface with a world map
            background to make it visually appealing. 🗺️ The app shows you the
            current time and date for various cities, including Tokyo 🇯🇵, Paris
            🇫🇷, and Rome 🇮🇹.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the app. The JavaScript
            code makes use of the Moment.js library, which helps me retrieve and
            format the current time and date for different time zones. 🕒
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            You can select a city from the dropdown menu, and the app will
            dynamically update the displayed time and date for that city. 🌆
            Plus, I added a special feature that shows the time and date for
            your current location automatically. 🌟
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            If you're curious about how it works, you can check out the code on
            my GitHub page. 📁 Feel free to explore it and even contribute if
            you'd like! The app is open source and ready for collaboration.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            I hope you find this World Clock app useful and enjoy keeping track
            of time around the globe! ⏱️✨

      <h2>A Journey of Creativity and Code 🎨🖥️</h2>

      <p>
        At the age of 28, I embarked on an exciting journey to blend my love for
        coding with my passion for creativity. When I'm not immersed in lines of
        code, you can find me surrounded by a delightful bunch of 15 cats. Their
        playful antics provide endless inspiration and joy. 🐱❤️
      </p>
      <h2>The Canvas of Artistic Expression 🎨✨</h2>
      <p>
        Art has always held a special place in my heart, and I've had the
        incredible opportunity to showcase my work in both group and personal
        exhibitions. In 2018, my art graced the walls of a captivating
        exhibition in Turkey, where I had the pleasure of connecting with fellow
        artists and art enthusiasts. Then, in 2020, I embarked on an
        unforgettable journey to Japan, where I shared my creativity in a
        personal exhibition. The experience was truly magical and allowed me to
        immerse myself in the rich culture and vibrant art scene. 🌟✨🎉

        sharing the wonders of mathematics with enthusiastic students. While I
        cherished the opportunity to make a positive impact on their lives, I
        couldn't ignore my deep-rooted love for coding and design. It was in
        2014, during a computer class, that the HTML/CSS magic first sparked
        within me. I knew then that I had found my true calling.
